2. Admin Song Management - The admin has the authority to upload new songs, categorize them (if needed), and manage the content available on the platform.
3. User Access Management (Admin Only) - The admin can create, delete, or manage user accounts, ensuring secure and controlled access to the platform.
4. Form-Based Interactions - Various Django forms are used to facilitate actions such as playlist creation, song addition (admin-only), and user registration/login.
